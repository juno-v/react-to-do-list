# Project Summary 
This is a simple to do list in React with minimal styling. 
It's meant for engineers to see how the code was written, and then reiterate it by hand in their own projects. 

# Folder structure 
src <br/>
|- ToDoList <br/> 
|---ToDoList.css /holds the styling for the project <br/>
|---ToDoList.js /holds the code for the to do list to work, it has comments to explain the code!  learn how this tutorial was written via the comments.
<br/>
the rest of the project are 99% what create-react-app gives you to function. there are minor things to tweak to get your app customized. see if you can guess what these files are and if there's anything different! 
<br/>
hint: check these files: 
<br/>
- index.js
- package.json
- .gitignore 
<br/> <br/> <br/>

#### for the most part in the intro here you don't touch anything in the these files/folders, so don't worry about them in session! research later: <br/>
node_modules <br/>
public <br>
package-lock.json <br/>
package.json <br/>
